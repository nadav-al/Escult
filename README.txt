Thing To Add:
1. Cat visible behind girl.
2. Cat intreacts with well to get souls.
3. "Light" switch - turn on/off.
4. Make inverse colliders - a path that you cant walk out of.
5. At the beggining of each stage, summon the cat via some animation.
6. Door for each direction?
7. Maybe Utily Class for tags.
8. Juice - Cat can Meow.





TODO now:
2. check if SendMessage is working????
3. Should cat spawn inside girl (then he is pushing her a bit and she goes off stage) or in a fixed position.
4. Cat thrown behind Alter causes problems - Plaster is right now we are using smaller colliders.
7. after building bridge - cat cannot get it - make collider smaller and make it to its legs. MAYBE CIRCLE COLLIDERS??
9. Maybe change bridgeTiles to singleton.
10. in levelManager, avoid using cat.
11. When girl enters door, we swap levels - the girl knows.
12. SetActive False to the souls of the cat.
13. Change the level - the grid is not the level - change the script level manager to be on the grid.
